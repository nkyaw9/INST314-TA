    <h1>Statistic Made Easy</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Treatment Group VS. Control Group</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Treatment Group: expose to the new variable</li>
      <li>Control Group: not exposed to the new variable</li>

    </ul>
    <p>Note: You will often encounter these types of tables, study them.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Variables</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are two types of variables: Categorical vs. Numerical</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Categorical: You cannot put a number on them (lables or names)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ordinal: Ordered categories (beginner, intermediate, advance)</li>
          <li>Nominal: Named (female and male)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Numerical: You can put a number on them (# numbers)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Continuous: Uncountable number of values (12.241251...)</li>
          <li>Discrete: Countable numbers (1, 2, 3,4)</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Independent Variable Vs. Dependent Variable</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Independent (explanatory): Cause</li>
      <li>Dependent (response): Effect</li>

      <li>
        Think of rise over run. Change in y-axis depends on the change in
        x-axis.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2>Association</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You identify if two variables are correlated by their correlation
        coffiecnt
      </li>
      <li>Range: -1 &le; x &le; 1</li>
      <li>0 means there is no corrlelation</li>
      <li>
        closer it gets to -1 or 1, the more the variables are negatively or
        positvely correlated
      </li>
      <li>Its either correlated or not, never both</li>
      <li>ASSOCIATION &ne; CAUSATION</li>
      <li>
        Even if two variables have a relationship, doesn't mean its causation as
        their might be other cofounding variables at play
      </li>

    <h2>Population, Parameter, Sample, Statistic</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Note: You need to be able to define these terms</li>
      <li>A population refers to ALL</li>
      <li>A sample refers to a subset of the population</li>
      <li>A parameter is a number that descibes the population</li>
      <li>A statistic is a number that describes the sample</li>
      <li>PP for population parameter & SS for sample statistic</li>
      <li>

    <h2>Study Design Observational Study</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Observational Studies: Observing without interfering with the environment</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Cohort (prospective): follows people forward to see what happens in the future</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Retrospective: uses existing records/data to look backward at what already happened</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cross-Sectional: what is happening right now (present)</li>
            <li>Case-Control: what happened in the past </li>
            <li>Note: Tries to establish correlation</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Experimental Studies: In a controlled setting</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Note: Tries to establish correlation</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Types of Summary Statistics</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Summary Statistic: One number that summarizes a lot of data</li>
      <li>Central Tendency (The center)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Mean: The average.</li>
        <li>Median: The literal middle value.</li>
        <li>Mode: The most frequent value.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Dispersion (The Spread)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Range: The diffence between the highest and lowest values.</li>
        <li>
          Standard Deviation: Shows how much the data varies from the average.
        </li>
        <li>
          Interquartile Range (IQR): Shows the spread of the middle 50% of the
          data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Shape: Describes how data is distributed</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Skewness</li>
        <li>Symmetric</li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        Note: If you understand these, you will have an easier time later. I
        would HIGHLY recommend watching this video:

          The other Summary Statistic are a little harder to understand so they
          will have their own section.
